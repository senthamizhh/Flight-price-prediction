        <h1><strong>Flight Price Prediction</strong></h1>
    </center>
    <h3 class="big"><em>The objective of this article is to predict flight prices given the various parameters.This will be a regression
        problem since the target or dependent variable is the price (continuous numeric valuye).Nowadays,the
        number of people using flights has increased significantly.it is difficult for airlines to maintain price since
        prices change dynamically due to different conditions.That's why we will try to use machine learning to
        solve this problem.This can help airlines by predicting what prices they can maintain.it can also help
        customers to predict future flight prices and plan their journy accordingly.
